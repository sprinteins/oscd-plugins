# Development process

The [Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/sprinteins/projects/7/views/1) and current [Sprint Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/sprinteins/projects/7/) can be found on github, next to the [project repo](https://github.com/sprinteins/oscd-plugins).

You need to be able to interact with Work Items :
* create, read, update, and delete issues
* add them to the project in order to make them appear in the backlog

## Version control management practice

We are following the [trunk-based development rules](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) : one trunk (main), short life feature branches that should not live longer than a sprint. 

## Sprint Backlog

* When you are assigned to an issue from the Sprint Backlog, please do the following:
	* Create a ney branch following the
	* Create a draft pull request
	* Assign one or more reviewers
	* Commit your changes

* When the issue is mature enough, mark your pull request as ready.

* Once the reviewer has validated the pull request, you are allowed to merge into main and delete the created branch.

## Changelog

Before each iteration, a changelog should list the last changes and the upcoming feature, as described by [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
