# Type Designer

## TODO (Remove before merge)

- [ ] ~~wird in allen dispatchCreate* unter dem namen "bay" (oder ld usw.) gespeichert, erwartet BayType, case sensitive~~
- [ ] update 19.09 - dispatcher saves nodes under <div> tag
- [ ] something like react hook form?
- [ ] File structure. A lot of functionality is scattered and not where it should be. Expected on 20.09
- [ ] For now its decided not to implement separate components for different node types - achieve complete agreement

This plugin serves as a collection of templates available for creating a substation schema.
