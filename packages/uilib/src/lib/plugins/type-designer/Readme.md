# Type Designer

## TODO (Remove before merge)

- [ ] wird unter dem namen "bay" gespeichert, erwartet BayType, case sensitive
- [ ] update 19.09 - dispatcher stopped saving changes into the scd file
- [ ] bay is type BayTypeElement - wrong, contains element, two types for the same node?
- [ ] File structure. A lot of functionality is scattered and not where it should be. Expected on 20.09
- [ ] For now its decided not to implement separate components for different node types - achieve complete agreement

This plugin serves as a collection of templates available for creating a substation schema.
