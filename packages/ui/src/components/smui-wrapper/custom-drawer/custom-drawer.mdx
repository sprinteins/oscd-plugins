# Custom Drawer
 
This component should wrap the content of your global application so that the drawer instance lives right next to it.
This is what it should looks like :

```html
<MaterialTheme pluginType={pluginType}>
	<plugin>
		<CustomDrawer>
				<main />
		</CustomDrawer>
	</plugin>
</MaterialTheme>
```

After importing the component, and creating a custom inner drawer component that suits your needs, you can use its store to control the drawer from anywhere in your application.

```js
import { drawerStore } from '@oscd-plugins/ui'
import DrawerInnerComponent from 'path-to-component'

drawerStore.switchDrawer({
		title: "My awesome drawer" /* drawer title */,
		description: "My custom component will be rendered just after the description" /* drawer description */,
		component: DrawerInnerComponent /* drawer custom inner component to create*/,
		componentProps: {
			hello: "world"
		} /* inner component props, if any */
	})
```
