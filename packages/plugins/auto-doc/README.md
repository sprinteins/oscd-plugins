# AutoDoc
The AutoDoc Plugin provides a documentation based on a scd file. The documentation includes custom elements like headlines, text areas and images. These elements can be added by the user. Additionally, there is the possibility to generate tables and diagrams derived from the scd data.
Additionally, there are defined elements like 'signal list'. These elements are automatically filled with the corresponding data from the scd file.
