# Libraries

## jsPDF
[jsPDF ↗](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) is a JS library used to generate PDF documents in the browser. It allows developers to create complex PDF documents with text, images, tables, and other graphical elements. 

We're using jsPDF in the AutoDoc Plugin to enable users to export their template based documentation as PDF files. The library allows us to generate such PDF documents directly from the browser without the need for server-side processing.
